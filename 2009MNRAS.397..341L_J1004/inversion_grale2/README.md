This script uses the same settings as the 2009 article, but now uses
grale2/pygrale instead of grale1/graleshell.

The imgdata files are basically the same as the ones in the grale1
directory. The only difference is the one with the time delay data,
where the delays are now stored slightly differently. The time delay
values, as well as the points contained in the file, are exactly the
same.
