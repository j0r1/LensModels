This json file can be opened with grale_editor, and shows two color images
that are aligned with the coordinates used in the imgdata files. The large color 
image is a PNG conversion of the TIFF file that can be
[downloaded](https://cdn.sci.esa.int/documents/34247/35306/1567220522934-heic0606b.tiff)
from the article
[Galaxy cluster SDSS j1004+4112 and lensed quasar](https://sci.esa.int/web/hubble/-/39286-galaxy-cluster-sdss-j1004-4112-and-lensed-quasar)
on the ESA site.

The smaller image is a color image I made back in 2009 from several HST
observations.

When the json file is opened, you can also open the imgdata files to see which
points, null space regions or caustic penalty regions have been used. Another
interesting option is to back-project one or more images to the source plane
and re-trace them. See the [relevant part](https://research.edm.uhasselt.be/~jori/grale2/tutorial.html#grale-editor)
of the documentation.
